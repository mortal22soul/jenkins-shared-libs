This step loads a script from the shared library resources, writes it to the workspace, and makes it executable.

Usage:
  loadScript(name: "<script-filename>")

Arguments:
  name - The name of the script located under resources/scripts/

Behavior:
  - Fetches the script from resources/scripts/<name>
  - Writes it to a file in the workspace with the same name
  - Adds execute permission (chmod +x)

Example:
  pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
          stage('Load and Run Script') {
              steps {
                  loadScript(name: "myscript.sh")
                  sh "./myscript.sh"
              }
          }
      }
  }
